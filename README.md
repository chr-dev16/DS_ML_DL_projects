# DS_ML_DL_projects

I contributed to various projects in the areas of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning during my studies. This is a collection of some of them.

##  Business Data Analytics

The task was to build a recommender system for movies like for instance Netflix uses it. We applied Singular Value Decomposition with a meta-learning architecture called stacking.

## Challenges in Supply Chain Management

The task was to extract decision-relevant information from the free text entries in BASF's financial reporting tools. Using LSTM recurrent neural networks inter alia, we performed a sentiment analysis of the texts and extracted differences between BASF's business units. We also created a dashboard with Tableau that visualizes time series and correlations. 

## Data Science

The task was to predict whether online shopping sessions are concluded with a purchasing transaction or not based on data from Google Analytics. We performed exploratory data analysis and trained different ML classifiers to compare their performance.

## Deep Neural Networks

For our course mini-project we selected the task of hand gesture recognition. We took 468 photos, segmented them and performed image classification through a newly developed CNN and via transfer learning.
